# Aflac Sentiment Analysis

This project explores public sentiment toward Aflac across Reddit, Twitter, and Trustpilot. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, I analyzed text data to uncover how people feel about the Aflac brand, and translated those findings into actionable insights.

## Problem Statement

Aflac wanted to better understand how customers perceive their brand online. This project aimed to:
- Scrape organic customer reviews and reactions across multiple platforms
- Perform sentiment analysis and text mining to surface brand perception trends
- Deliver visualizations and insights that could support customer experience decisions

---

## Tools Used

- **Python** (TextBlob, Pandas, NLTK)
- **Tableau**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **Reddit, Twitter, and Trustpilot Scraping**

---

## Key Steps

1. Scraped and cleaned text from Reddit threads, Tweets, and Trustpilot reviews
2. Tokenized, filtered, and processed the text using NLTK
3. Calculated polarity/subjectivity scores with TextBlob
4. Built n-grams and performed TF-IDF scoring to identify key themes
5. Visualized insights using Tableau dashboards

---

## Sample Visuals

*Sentiment over time by platform, TF-IDF keyword clouds, polarity vs star rating charts.*

## Final Insights

- Trustpilot reviews were highly polarized â€” most were either 1-star or 5-star
- Reddit provided deeper, more narrative-driven criticism
- Twitter showed mostly neutral or shallow brand mentions
- Overall sentiment leaned slightly positive but skewed neutral

---

## Future Improvements

- Add more advanced sentiment models (e.g., RoBERTa or BERT)
- Incorporate engagement metrics (likes, retweets, comments)
- Analyze entity-level sentiment (e.g., Aflac agents, claims process)
